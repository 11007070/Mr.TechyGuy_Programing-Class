<h1>Where does Kayla want to travel?</h1>
<p id="y">I want to travel back to Jamica. I have already been to Jamica once before, but I loved it so much that I would ove to go back. In Jamica, at the hotel, they had a waterslide, lazy river, buffets that are open for almost the whole day, shows everynight, and the beach just a few steps away.</p>
